// JS uses two types of memory: Stack (Premitive) and Heap (Reference)

// Premitive data creates a copy of the original when assigned to a new variable.
// Reference data creates a reference to the original when assigned to a new variable.

// Any changes in Stack Data or Premitive data doesn't affect the original data.
// Any changes in Heap Data or Reference data also applies to the main data as it is the reference point.
